# AIMS high end computing 

High end computing in the context of AIMS and government security
policies

This repository represents a collection of explorations into how to
support high-end computing whilst conforming to the AIMS IT polices
(in particular using the current AIMS Windows SOE).
Each folder represents a separate exploration.

If contributing, with a either a new exploration or making edits to an
existing exploration, please treat these as commented recipes with the
following structure:

- **Overview** - include a brief description of the approach (what it
  achieves, solves etc).  Ideally, frame with a simple motivating
  example - that is a minimum working example (MWE).

- **Dependencies** - include a list of required software or other
  dependencies/services above the standard SOE

- **Approach** - include a commented set of instructions to replicate
  the exploration (ideally with a MWE).  This should be the 'meat' of
  the exploration documentation and if possible include all code
  snippets, files or configurations required to replicate the
  exploration.

- **Limitiation** - provide a list of issues, limitations, restriction
  and/or hurdles.

**As this is a publically available repository, please do not include 
any sensitive information such as ports, hostsnames, ip addresses etc**.  
Instead, please include either a link to an internal ICT Knowledgebase 
article or details on how the information can be gleaned from your 
machine.
